 If Statement:- For example, if the weather is nice today, then we will go outside. If the alarm clock rings, then we’ll shut it off. If we’re tired, then we’ll go to sleep.

 The if keyword followed by a set of parentheses () which is followed by a code block, or block statement, indicated by a set of curly braces {}.

If.....else:-

An else statement must be paired with an if statement, and together they are referred to as an if...else statement.

In the example above, the else statement:

Uses the else keyword following the code block of an if statement.
Has a code block that is wrapped by a set of curly braces {}.
The code inside the else statement code block will execute when the if statement’s condition evaluates to false.
if...else statements allow us to automate solutions to yes-or-no questions, also known as binary decisions.

Comparison Operators:-
When writing conditional statements, sometimes we need to use different types of operators to compare values. These operators are called comparison operators.
Here is a list of some handy comparison operators and their syntax:
Less than: <
Greater than: >
Less than or equal to: <=
Greater than or equal to: >=
Is equal to: ===
Is not equal to: !==

Logical Operators:-
Working with conditionals means that we will be using booleans, true or false values.
There are three logical operators:
the and operator (&&)
the or operator (||)
the not operator, otherwise known as the bang operator (!)

Truthy and Falsy:-Let’s consider how non-boolean data types, like strings or numbers, are evaluated when checked inside a condition.
Sometimes, you’ll want to check if a variable exists and you won’t necessarily want it to equal a specific value — you’ll only check to see if the variable has been assigned a value.

So which values are falsy— or evaluate to false when checked as a condition? The list of falsy values includes:
0
Empty strings like "" or ''
null which represent when there is no value at all
undefined which represent when a declared variable lacks a value
NaN, or Not a Number

Truthy and Falsy Assignment:-Truthy and falsy evaluations open a world of short-hand possibilities!

Ternary Operator:- In the spirit of using short-hand syntax, we can use a ternary operator to simplify an if...else statement.

Else If Statements:-We can add more conditions to our if...else with an else if statement. The else if statement allows for more than two possible outcomes.  The else if statement always comes after the if statement and before the else statement.
if/else if/else statements are read from top to bottom, so the first condition that evaluates to true from the top to bottom is the block that gets executed.

The switch keyword:-
A switch statement provides an alternative syntax(to else if else) that is easier to read and write.
